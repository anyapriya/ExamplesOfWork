The assignment itself is [here](https://github.com/anyapriya/ExamplesOfWork/blob/master/LSE%20-%20Distributed%20Computing%20for%20Big%20Data/Homework1/homework-1.ipynb).

The entire assignment uses Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  Part A focuses on Spark RDDs, Part B focuses on Spark SQL, and Part C focuses on Hive.
