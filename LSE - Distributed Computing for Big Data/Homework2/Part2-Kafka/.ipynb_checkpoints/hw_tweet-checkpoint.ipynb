    "I looked at the mean and variance for number of tweets that mentioned jazz.  For python files used, please see kafka_twitter_producer.py and pysparkStatefulTweetSummaryStatsFinal.py.  For explanation of how they were run, see README.md.  For mathematical derivations of part A (especially $a_n$ and $b_n$), see HWPart2Math.pdf.  The output is shown below.  \n",

    "In this homework problem your task is to track the sample mean and unbiased sample variance of the number of words per tweet using the Spark streaming API. Please write functions to calculate the mean and variance for all the tweets that you receive over time, not just for the last received batch of the stream. \n",
    "This means that you need to calculate the mean and the variance recursively using the Spark streaming concept of a \"stateful\" operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you may also use `nc` to manually stream messages instead of using the twitter stream, if you have trouble getting the twitter stream to run.\n",

    "Calculate two different versions of sample mean and variance estimators with different step sizes:\n",

    "**A. decaying step size**: Recursive evaluations of mean and unbiased sample variance for an input stream of observations $x_1, x_2, \\ldots$ with decaying step size:\n",

    "\n",
    "My output of running this is shown below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **A.2 (max points 10)**: Sample variance $\\sigma^2_{n+1} = a_n \\sigma^2_n + b_n (x_{n+1}-m_n)^2$ where $a_n$ and $b_n$ are two sequences whose values you need to work out first.\n",
