############################ Contents ############################

# This contains the two initialization functions that are called by PSOMain.py
# This also contains two initialization functions specifically for velocity and 
#    position which are called by the two main initialization functions














############################ Variable descriptions ############################

# D is the number of dimensions (int)
# N is the number of particles (int)
# bounds of the search area - of the form [[x1min, x1max], ... , [xDmin, xDmax]]
# bound is the search area bound for one dimension (one entry of bounds)
# f is the function to be optimized

# pcurr is the current position of each particles
# vcurr is the current velocity of each particles
# pbest is the best position of each particle
# fbest is the minimum value found for each particle
# fgbest is the overall minimum value found of all particles
# pgbest is the overall best position of each particle












############################ Initialization Functions ############################
