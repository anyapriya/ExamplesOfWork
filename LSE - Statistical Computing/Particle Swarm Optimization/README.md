# Particle Swarm Algorithm

This project is primarily about implementing the Particle Swarm and Quantum Particle Swarm Algorithms.  For both algorithms, we also implemented a parallelized version.  The primary code is contained in the file PSOMain.py.  The test functions used are in the file PSOTestFuncs.py.  The functions to initialize the algorithm are in the file PSOInit.py, and the functions to update the algorithm are in the file PSOUpdate.py.  Descriptions of all variables used in each file are found within the files at the beginning.
