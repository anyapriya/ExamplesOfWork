# This contains the three update functions that are called by PSOMain.py















############################ Variable descriptions ############################

# D is the number of dimensions (int)
# N is the number of particles (int)
# bounds of the search area - of the form [[x1min, x1max], ... , [xnmin, xnmax]]
# bound is the search area bound for one dimension (one entry of bounds)
# f is the function to be optimized
# params are the necessary parameters (omega, c1, c2) for PSO

# pcurr is the current position of each particles
# vcurr is the current velocity of each particles (PSO and parallelized PSO only)
# pbest is the best position of each particle
# fbest is the minimum value found for each particle
# fgbest is the overall minimum value found of all particles
# pgbest is the overall best position of each particle
# mbest is mean of each particle's best position by dimension (QPSO and QPSO_par only)
# x is the proposed movement, which is made if it is an improvement from the particles last location
    # (QPSO and QPSO_par only)

# newp is a temporary calculation of the new position, saved to pcurr if inside the bounds
# newx_id is a temporary calculation of the new x, saved to x if inside the bounds

# rpg
# phi
# u
# beta
# changeParam
# coinToss - 50% chance of being True / False, used in QPSO to decide to add or subtract changeParam
