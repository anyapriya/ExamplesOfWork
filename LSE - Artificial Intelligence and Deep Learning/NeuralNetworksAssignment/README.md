# Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Assignment 1 - Neural Networks

This assignment focuses on using neural networks for image classification.  The assignment itself is contained [here](https://github.com/anyapriya/ExamplesOfWork/blob/master/LSE%20-%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Assignment1/Assignment1.md).  

Part 1 focuses on classification using neural networks with multi-class logistic regression and various optimization algorithms.  My work for Part 1 is [here](https://github.com/anyapriya/ExamplesOfWork/blob/master/LSE%20-%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Assignment1/AIAssignment1P1.ipynb).  

Parts 2 and 3 focus on using CNN for image classification.  My work for Part 2 is [here](https://github.com/anyapriya/ExamplesOfWork/blob/master/LSE%20-%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Assignment1/AIAssignment1P2.ipynb) and my work for Part 3 is [here](https://github.com/anyapriya/ExamplesOfWork/blob/master/LSE%20-%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Assignment1/AIAssignment1P3.ipynb).
